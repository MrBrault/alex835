<h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>Sam is something of a neat-freak. He has always wanted things nice and neat and is
    pretty particular about things being in order. His parents always teased that maybe
    he should be a housekeeper when he grows up. He took them serious and started working
    on cleaning houses as a side job. It was only enough to be part-time work until last
    year when he finally hired a staff and started cleaning houses full time.</p>
